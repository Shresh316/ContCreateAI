🚀 InstaBoost AI (2026)
The Future of Creator Growth. Gamified. AI-Powered.

⚡ Project Overview
InstaBoost AI is a next-gen dashboard built for the Innovation Hackathon 2026. It solves "Creator Burnout" by transforming boring social media analytics into a high-stakes, cyberpunk RPG experience.

Instead of staring at spreadsheets, creators "Level Up" by completing engagement missions. We utilize Mistral AI to generate viral strategies, analyze caption sentiment, and predict growth trends—all wrapped in a futuristic Glassmorphism UI.

✨ Key Features
🤖 Mistral AI Assistant: A real-time chat bot integrated directly into the dashboard to generate viral hooks, hashtags, and content ideas instantly.

🎮 Gamified Growth: An RPG-style XP system. Complete daily quests (e.g., "Reply to 3 comments") to level up your dashboard.

📊 Predictive Analytics:

Growth Projections: AI-simulated follower forecasting.

Heatmaps: Visual "Best Time to Post" grids.

Sentiment Analysis: Audience vibe detection (Positive vs. Toxic).

⚔️ Competitor Warfare: A Radar Chart system to compare your engagement stats directly against rival accounts.

🛠️ Creator Toolkit:

Shadowban Scanner: Simulated terminal to diagnose account health.

Aesthetic DNA: Auto-extracts color palettes from your feed.

AI Roast: Get a brutal AI critique of your feed's vibe.

🔮 Future Roadmap (What's Next?)
We plan to scale InstaBoost AI from a hackathon prototype to a full SaaS product. Here is our development timeline:

[ ] Real-Time API Integration: Connect to the official Instagram Graph API to fetch live user data instead of simulated hackathon data.

[ ] Computer Vision Analysis: Implement AI that scans uploaded images to rate their "aesthetic quality" and probability of going viral before posting.

[ ] Multi-Platform Support: Expand the dashboard to track YouTube Shorts and TikTok analytics in one unified view.

[ ] Auto-Scheduler: Allow users to schedule posts directly from the "Grid Planner" tool.

[ ] Mobile App: Port the web dashboard to React Native for on-the-go analytics.


🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism, Neon FX), JavaScript (ES6+).

AI Engine: Mistral AI API (via Fetch).

Data Viz: Chart.js (Interactive graphs).

UI Libraries: Vanilla-tilt.js (3D Parallax effects), FontAwesome.
